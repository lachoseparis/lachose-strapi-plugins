  <h1>Strapi v4 - Custom Links</h1>
</div>

A plugin for [Strapi](https://github.com/strapi/strapi) that allows you to create and edit URI for different ContentTypes.

# üîå Installation

```sh
npm install strapi-plugin-custom-links
```

**or**

```sh
yarn add strapi-plugin-custom-links
```

# ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

You can configure the plugin directly from the Strapi interface in developer mode.

Go to **Settings > Custom-Links Plugin > Configuration**

And add content-types you wish to associate Custom-Links and just save it.

![plugin settings](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/505236/181905076-bcbaca58-ec4d-4d5c-ad0d-84f14329bd9e.png)

**_NOTE_**

Alternatively, you can create the config file by your own, by creating a file `custom-links.js` inside the folder config of your strapi project.

The file looks like this :

`./config/custom-links.js`

```javascript
'use strict';

module.exports = {
  contentTypes: ['api::mycontenttype.mycontenttype', 'api::othercontentype.othercontentype'],
};
```

# ‚úèÔ∏è Create and edit Custom-Links

## From the Content Manager

When editing a Content-Type, you will find at the right section a Custom-Link block, in wich you can create or update a Custom-Link by editing the URI field.

## From the Custom-Links plugin section

You will be able to retrieve the list of Custom-Links from **Plugins > Custom-Links** section.

In this section you can search, filter, update or delete Custom-Links.

## Schema

| Field     | Type         | Unique | minLength | regExp                | Description                           |
| --------- | ------------ | ------ | --------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| id        | `biginteger` | true   | 1         |                       | The id of the Custom-Link             |
| uri       | `string`     | true   | 1         | `^/[a-zA-Z0-9-_./]*$` | The uri of the Custom-Link            |
| kind      | `string`     | false  | -         | -                     | The uid of the ContentType associated |
| contentId | `biginteger` | false  | -         | -                     | The id of the ContentType associated  |
## Basic Usage

### Note on proxy pattern

Our own use of this plugin is to only rely on the URI to request every content-type (the same way you would request a node with Drupal 8) then dynamically create a template according to the nature of the data returned.
This is a pattern called **proxy**.

Since this plugin can be enabled only on a few content-types, we reckon that you might need to fetch the custom-link collection itself (see Alternative usage)

### Endpoints

As we always try to stay as close as possible of the strapi default behavior and core concept while developing this plugin, we think that per URI request shouldn't be used with a `GET` parameters because they prevent the request to be cached by the browser and are harder to manage behind a CDN.

| Method | URL                            | Description                                         | Details                                          |
| ------ | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `GET`  | `/api/custom-links/proxy/:uri` | Fetch the data of a Content-Type by its Custom-Link | By default components and relations are populate |

### Response

`/api/custom-links/proxy/my-article-uri`
```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": 1,
    "attributes": {
      "title": "My article",
      "slug": "my-article",
      "createdAt": "2022-08-01T16:32:35.878Z",
      "updatedAt": "2022-08-01T16:32:35.878Z",
      "component": [
        {
          "id": 1,
          "text": "A component"
        }
      ],
      "content": [
        {
          "__component": "core.component",
          "id": 2,
          "text": "A dyn component"
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  "meta": {
    "meta": {
      "customLink": {
        "id": "1",
        "uri": "/my-article-uri",
        "kind": "api::article.article",
        "contentId": "1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

As you can see on the previous example we inject customLink data inside the meta of the result. This can also be used to retrieve a specific custom-link as seen in the following part.


## Alternative Usage

You can also use the custom-link classic CRUD which exposes the same endpoints as the strapi default controller.

By requesting a Custom-Link collection, you can retrieve the kind (the Content-Type uid) and the contentId (the id of the ContentType) and then request the Content-Type associated.

This can be useful if you need to know the target content-type before making the request.
